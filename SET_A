( Set A )
1. WAP to find whether a given number is evil number or not? An evil number is
a number which has even number of 1's in its binary equivalent.
Input – number n
Output – evil / not evil
Sample –
Input – 101011
Output - evil
Input – 10101
Output – not evil

2. Write a function to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should
be at least 3).
If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead.
If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it
unchanged.
The function returns the updated string.
Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'
Sample String : 'no'
Expected Result : 'no'

3. Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input, and
output the words which occur more than once.
Sample –
Input – 􀅩New to Python or wanna learn Python then you should read Python
Documentation or go to internet􀅪.
Output –
Python : 3
to : 2

4. Create a class Set. Make a method called intersection(l1,l2) which accepts
with two given lists, and returns a list whose elements are intersection of
the above given list.
Sample –
Input –
L1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
L2 = [1,3,5,7,9,11]
Returns – [1,3,5,7]

5. Write a python program to find the longest word in a file. File is
􀅩poem.txt􀅪. Print the word and its length.

6. Outputs

i)
spam=[1,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8,10]
print(spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] )

ii)
spam = ['cats', 'dogs', 'moose']
bacon = ['dogs', 'moose', 'cats']
print(spam == bacon)
eggs = {'name': 'Zophie', 'species': 'cat', 'age': '8'}
ham = {'species': 'cat', 'age': '8', 'name': 'Zophie'}
print(eggs == ham)

iii)
class A(object):
x = 1
class B(A):
pass
class C(A):
pass
print(A.x, B.x, C.x)
B.x = 2
print(A.x, B.x, C.x)
A.x = 3
print(A.x, B.x, C.x)

7. Errors if any -
i) x = 10
def func():
x += 1
print(x)
func()

8. Differences -
i) What is the MAJOR difference between lists and dictionaries ?
Explain with example.

ii) Diff between
a= (42)
b= (42,)

iii) Is the ouput of A and B same? If yes, why? If no, gie the different
outputs.

A. def func(bar = []):
bar.append('xyz')
return bar
print(func())

B. def func(bar = []):
bar.extend('xyz')
return bar
print(func())
